# 👋 Hi, I'm Thomas Haddock

Welcome to my personal GitHub repo — a space where I share recent and ongoing Python projects, analytics workflows, and prototypes I’ve built across both personal and professional contexts.

Currently, I am in the process of replicating the workflows I have done within my AI Squared account here on my personal site. 

## 💼 About Me

I’m a Founding Sales Engineer and Solutions Architect at AI Squared, where I help Fortune 500 clients deploy enterprise-grade AI/ML solutions, build real-time data workflows, and bridge the gap between technical implementation and business value.

With experience across Python, SQL, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Snowflake), and modern data tools (React, Tableau, REST APIs), I enjoy building out POCs, demos, and internal tooling to accelerate adoption and collaboration.

## ⚙️ What You'll Find Here (Soon)

- Mr. Milchick: A Virtual Mahattan Real Estate Agent (Prototype)

_- Exploratory notebooks using Python, Pandas, and SQL
- Lightweight app concepts (e.g. Streamlit, Flask)
- Data integration & transformation pipelines
- Visualization experiments and demo dashboards
- Experimentation with GenAI, RAG, and LLM workflows_

## 📫 Connect With Me

Feel free to reach out if you're exploring collaboration, hiring for technical sales roles, or just want to nerd out on modern data infrastructure.
